# Jobly

Jobly is a mock job application site. Users can signup, access a full list of mock companies and related jobs and "apply" to jobs they are interested in. This is a full stack web app built with JS/React in the frontend, Node/Express.js in the backend with a PostgreSQL database.

## Jobly Website

There is a public version of Jobly available at https://jobly-gg1h.onrender.com/

## How to run Jobly Yourself

Jobly is split into two subdirectories: frontend and backend. Both need to have their indiviual dependencies downloaded and start commands run.

To set up Jobly:

1. Clone or download this repo
2. For each of the _frontend/_ and _backend/_ subfolders, navigate into the folder and enter `npm i`
3. To start the backend server, navigate into the backend/ folder and enter `node server.js` into the terminal. Or `nodemon server.js ` if you prefer to use nodemon
4. To start the frontend navigate into the frontend/ folder and enter `npm start` into the terminal. Now a new window with Jobly running should open in your default browser
